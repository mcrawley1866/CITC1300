                    <p>In the Season 1 finale of Paradise, the identity of President Cal Bradford’s assassin is revealed. The killer is Trent, the bunker’s librarian, who was once a project manager during the facility’s construction. Twelve years earlier, Trent discovered toxic conditions at the construction site that led to worker illnesses and deaths. After being fired and failing to gain media attention, he attempted to assassinate President Bradford but was thwarted by Xavier Collins. Disguised as the librarian, Trent infiltrated the bunker, ultimately killing Bradford with a construction tool. After confessing, Trent commits suicide in front of Collins and Agent Robinson.
